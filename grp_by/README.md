# **Earthquake Data Analysis and Prediction System**
## **Project Overview**
This is a comprehensive earthquake data analysis and prediction system that integrates data processing, visualization, comparison of multiple machine learning models, and spatial clustering analysis. The system can process earthquake data, extract various features, and use multiple machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering analysis.

## **Motivation**
### Why did we choose earthquake data analysis as our topic?

Our choice stems primarily from a natural scientific curiosity and its scientific significance: earthquakes, as an unsolved mystery, are among the deadliest natural disasters. In the 21st century alone, earthquakes have caused over 800,000 deaths. Earthquake prediction is considered the "holy grail" of Earth science. While we know we cannot "solve" this problem, systematically analyzing data and searching for patterns is itself a process of scientific exploration.

### What real problem or question does our project attempt to solve?
We can't help but ask: Are these earthquakes isolated or interconnected? Why do large earthquakes seem to "cluster" together? Are there global earthquake triggering mechanisms that we don't yet understand? Do these regions correspond to the approximate directions of known seismic zones? Can we use algorithms to automatically identify them?

Furthermore, the spatiotemporal "clustering patterns" of this narrative-rich data also intrigue us: Do earthquakes, like weather, have "active seasons" and "quiet seasons"? Are there predictable temporal patterns in seismic activity? For example, are earthquakes more likely to occur at certain times of day or in certain months of the year? The data itself tells a complex story about Earth's dynamics.

## **3.Hyperparameter Tuning**
This project applies a unified and systematic hyperparameter tuning strategy across all classification, regression, and clustering models. The goal is to ensure fairness, stability, and optimal performance for each model family.

### 1. Search Algorithms
Two search strategies are used depending on model complexity:

- **GridSearchCV** — exhaustive search for small/medium spaces  
- **RandomizedSearchCV** — efficient search for large or heavy models  

All tuning procedures use **5-fold cross-validation** to avoid overfitting and ensure stable model comparison.


### 2. Evaluation Metrics for Tuning
Different tasks use different primary metrics:

| Task Type | Primary Metric | Secondary Metrics |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Classification** | **F1 Score**, AUC-ROC | Accuracy, Precision, Recall |
| **Regression** | **R² Score**, MAE | MSE, RMSE |
| **Clustering** | **Silhouette Score**, DBI | CH Index |

Corresponding scoring passed into the tuner:
```
python
scoring_classification = "f1_weighted"
scoring_regression = "r2"
```
### 3. Search Space Design
Each model uses a carefully selected hyperparameter set:
- Core structure parameters (e.g., depth, number of estimators)

- Regularization parameters (e.g., C, alpha, l1_ratio)

- Learning parameters (e.g., learning_rate for boosting models)

The design avoids extremely large grids to prevent overfitting and excessive computation.
### 4. Model-Specific Tuning Examples

Only representative models are shown here.
Other models follow the same tuning framework with task-appropriate search spaces.  

**Example 1: Random Forest (Classification)**
```
python
param_grid = {
    "n_estimators": [100, 200, 300],
    "max_depth": [10, 20, None],
    "min_samples_split": [2, 5, 10]
}
grid = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid,
                    scoring="f1_weighted", cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_rf = grid.best_estimator_
```

                    scoring="r2", cv=5)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_rf_reg = grid.best_estimator_
```
**Example 3: KMeans (Clustering)**
```
python
best_score = -1
best_k = None
for k in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
    model = KMeans(n_clusters=k)
    labels = model.fit_predict(X)
    score = silhouette_score(X, labels)
    if score > best_score:
        best_score = score
        best_k = k
```

## **Conclusion**
### Summary of the Earthquake Analysis Project

This project performed end-to-end analysis of earthquake data, including data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, multi-model comparison (classification, regression), and spatial clustering.

**Classification Model:** To predict "major earthquakes" (magnitude ≥4.5), Random Forest achieved the best performance (F1=0.678, AUC=0.649).

**Regression Model:** To predict earthquake magnitude, Gradient Boosting performed best (R²=0.497, MAE≈0.5).

**Clustering Model:** Spatial analysis (DBSCAN/KMeans) identified 5–8 seismic clusters, with KMeans (K=2) showing clearer spatial patterns.

---
### Core Findings
1. **Temporal Patterns:** Earthquakes exhibited distinct daily and monthly patterns, with certain hours and months experiencing higher frequencies.
2. **Spatial Clustering:** Significant spatial clustering was observed, indicating regions prone to seismic activity, which could be crucial for targeted monitoring and early warning systems.
3. **Feature Importance:** Features such as spatial clusters, rolling mean magnitudes, and lagged magnitudes were identified as highly influential in predicting earthquake occurrences and magnitudes.
4. **Model Performance:** Random Forest and XGBoost emerged as top performers across both classification and regression tasks, demonstrating robustness in handling the complexity of earthquake data.
---
### Limitations of the Earthquake Analysis Project
1. **Data Constraints:**
   - The dataset size (1,308 records) is relatively small, limiting the generalization ability of complex models.
   - Missing features (e.g., tectonic plate boundaries, historical seismic activity) reduce prediction accuracy.

2. **Model Limitations:**
   - The best R² (0.497) for magnitude prediction is low—earthquake magnitude is inherently stochastic, and current features cannot fully capture its variability.
   - Classification models struggle with imbalanced data (few major earthquakes), leading to suboptimal recall.

3. **Methodological Gaps:**
   - Time-series splitting (TSCV) was used, but no external validation dataset was available to test real-world performance.
   - Spatial clustering did not integrate geological context (e.g., fault lines), so cluster interpretation is purely data-driven.
